# DeadLock Implementation using Flutter

# Deadlock Detection and Prevention in Flutter

[![Flutter Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/flutter-%3E%3D2.0-blue.svg)](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

## Description

This Flutter project aims to demonstrate a simple implementation of deadlock detection and prevention in concurrent programming. Deadlocks can occur when multiple processes or threads compete for resources and can't proceed, resulting in a system-wide stall. The implementation provided here showcases techniques to identify and prevent deadlocks in a Flutter environment.

## Features

- **Deadlock Detection:** Illustrates how to identify potential deadlocks within the Flutter application.
  
- **Prevention Strategies:** Demonstrates techniques to prevent and mitigate deadlocks in concurrent scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/deadlock-flutter.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd deadlock-flutter
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Usage

Describe how users can interact with or test the deadlock scenarios within your Flutter application. Provide code snippets or usage examples if applicable.
